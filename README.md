# Lua Arithmetic Error with String Input

This repository demonstrates a common Lua error: attempting to perform arithmetic operations on a string value.  The `foo` function expects a number, but when provided a string, it throws an error. This example highlights the importance of input validation in Lua functions.

The `bug.lua` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.lua` provides a corrected version with input validation.
